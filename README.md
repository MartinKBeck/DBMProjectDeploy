# Fall 2019 Database Management Midterm Project

The following repository contains code used in me and my partner Gina Huh's DBM midterm project.
The code consists of a web application developed in python using the Django framework, it utilizes ORM to queries. 

Code was developed to be deployed on Google App Engine and utilizes CloudSQL as the DB.

The application is meant to be an employee point giving web application where employees can gift eachother points as they see fit. Team members that received points are able to then redeem these points for giftcards.

Admin members are able to reset points that are given out for the month.
